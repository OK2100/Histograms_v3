	You just need to do a few steps

	1)	Include in your project qcustomplot.h and qcustomplot.cpp
		from the oficial pack

	2)	#include "qcustomplot.h" where you need it

	3)	Add "printsupport" module in .pro file: 
		"QT += widgets"	-----> "QT += widgets printsupport"

	4)	- Add to .ui form an empty widget 
		- Click right mouse button on it
		- Select "promote to...`" and fill "Promoted class name" field 
		  by "QCustomPlot" 

	After compiling you should see an area with grid and axes on your window.



	Terminology:

	Key and Value are independent and dependent variables on the plot
